Thanks for contributing ! Here are the syntax guidelines I'd like to respect:

  - 2 spaces for indentation
  - no hard tabs, ever
  - `make indent` should leave the code as is
  - travis is always right
  - aim for â‰¥90% coverage (green badge).

I prefer working on several, independent branches for small features, and merge
after on master. See [github-flow](http://guides.github.com/overviews/flow/).
